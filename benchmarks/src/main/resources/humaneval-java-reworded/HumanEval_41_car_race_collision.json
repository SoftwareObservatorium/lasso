The two sets of cars start out being very far from\n each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide\n when a car that\u0027s moving left to right hits a car that\u0027s moving right to left.\n However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving\n in their trajectory as if they did not collide."}
